# **The seven chakras**

## **Site overview**

The seven chakras is a website that informs people about the seven energy centers in the human body named as seven chakras. The seven chakras, also known as wheels, align along the central axis of the body from the crown of the head to the base of the spine. It helps users understand which chakra is responsbile for which energy center and explains the methods to make the energy flow again by balancing the chakras.

### **Target audience**

* Users who practice yoga or meditation.
* Users who feel low in energy and want to know how to balance it.
* Users who are generally interested in the concepts of chakras and the beliefs of ancients.

## **Themes**

### **Color scheme**

* For the background I used a subtle color, with the aim to keep the appearance relaxing. As this is a website for energy centers and medidation I did not want go for something overwhelming.
* For the top header I used a meroon shade with a same color shadow appearing on the top of the footer and bottom of the navigation to keep the consistency.
* For the navigation I have chose a black color with white text. This color went well with the overall design of the website. Repeatedly for the consistency a meroon color is chosen for the hover(slightly transparant) and on active.
* On the seven chakras page a slightly transparant tone has been used that relates to the color of the chakras to make to page look visually attractive to the users.  

The colors are checked using color grid:

### **Typography**

The fonts were sourced from Google Fonts. Also, I used Fontjoy to find a suitable font for all pages. I ended up chosing three fonts which complimented each other well and kept the readability well.

* Montserat: for the title h1 and navigation.
* Lora: for all subheadings h2-h4.
* Hind Madurai: for all other texts/paragraphs.

## **Approach**

Mobile first approach has been used in this project with the reason: It is easier to get element from a small device fit on a larger device. Media queries have been used to override the code for larger devices such as tablets, laptops desktops. I have taken care of screen sizes starting from 300px to above. If its get above 1400px then the content is centered and still visible on the screen. 

## **Generic features - on all pages**

### **Header**

Each page consists of a header with three elements: a title, navigation and a hero image.

#### **Title**

* The title serves as the main name of the website, which is self explanatory: "The seven chakras".
* The title is clickable and brings the user from every page back to the about page.
* For the title the Font-family Montserat is used. For me this heading had a simple yet powerful look. This was also the top of the typography theme which I mentioned in the section before.

#### **Navigation**

* The navigation consists of four tabs: About, Seven chakras, Balancing and contact. 
* Each tab is descriptive to the page content. 
* The selected page has a meroon color.
* When hovered over the navigation tabs a partly meroon color is visible.
* The navigation has two styles - for smaller screen it is a hamburger menu with a vertical list. The list items can be seen using the hamburger menu. 
* The hamburger menu is set to do not display on larger screens. Instead the list items are shown vertically and are always visible on the screen.

#### **Hero image**

* Hero image to make the the page visually attractive. 
* Except making the website look better visually these images dont serve any motive.
* The images are chosen based on the content that I found suitable and attractive.
*   About: A sitting person in yoga posture with smaller chakra images showing on top of it. These are placed according to where the chakra is located. This gives a good overview of chakras. Also,the image colors, mainly black and yellow, go well with the website theme, therefore this image gives a good presence to the index/about page.

The main section covers most of the space. By using a flex in the property the footer is pushed down at the end of the page.
