## **Site overview**

The seven chakras, also known as wheels, align along the central axis of the body from the crown of the head to the base of the spine. It helps users understand which chakra is responsbile for which energy center and explains the methods to make the energy flow again by balancing the chakras.

Each page consists of a header with three elements:

## **Themes**

### **Color scheme**

* For the background I used a subtle color, with the aim to keep the appearance relaxing. As this is a website for energy centers and medidation I did not want go for something overwhelming.
* For the top header I used a meroon shade with a same color shadow appearing on the top of the footer and bottom of the navigation to keep the consistency.
* For the navigation I have chose a black color with white text. This color went well with the overall design of the website. Repeatedly for the consistency a meroon color is chosen for the hover(slightly transparant) and on active.
* On the seven chakras page a slightly transparant tone has been used that relates to the color of the chakras to make to page look visually attractive to the users.

### **Typography**

The fonts were sourced from Google Fonts. Also, I used Fontjoy to find a suitable font for all pages. I ended up chosing three fonts which complimented each other well and kept the readability well.

* Montserat: for the title h1 and navigation.
* Lora: for all subheadings h2-h4.
* Hind Madurai: for all other texts/paragraphs.
