# **The seven chakras Testing**

## **Testing methods**

Several methods have been used for continuous improvement during the project as well as test post finishing the project. The first part of this document covers the issues faced and solved during the project. The second part is about the testing after.

## **During the project**

The following manual methods were used for testing:

1. Testing by changing the code in GitPod and viewing the output on port 8000. I continously checked this on the responsiveness and made media queries where needed. I made changes in the "inspect" part just to see what impact my changes would have and to find any issues. For example a part of my screen was showing blank and the main part was not getting covered by it. By using the inspect option I came to know what was causing this issue. Also, below the footer there were some additional quotes which did allow the footer to align to the bottom. I managed to get both of these issues resolved.
2. Deployed the website via GitHub and checked how the website would look here. From here I discovered that not all images were showing which were visible on the testing website. The reason for this was that I used absolute values instead of relative values.
3. Checked the website several browsers e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This did not cause any issues. No issues were found here.
4. Shared the URL with my family so they could have a look at their devices and see if everything is readable and showing up correctly. No issues were found here.
5. Mentor session with David on 9 April, 14 April and 17 April. I kept a log with all my questions and all improvement points mentioned in the meetings. The points that came out of the meeting are as following:
