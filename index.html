            <h2>About chakras</h2>
            <p class="line-break-top-bottom">Chakra is a word in Sanskrit, an ancient language from India, that means
                “wheel” or “cycle”. Chakras are
                seen as spinning wheels or circles that flows energy through your body. When your chakras are in
                balance, life energy is able to move through them and connect you to the world around you. </p>

            <h2>Origin chakras</h2>
            <p class="line-break-top-bottom">Beliefs about chakras started in India, at least 1,000 years ago, as part
                of Hindu
                and Buddhist spiritual
                traditions. Some people think chakra beliefs are even older, going back to 1500 BCE or further. Chakras
                are mentioned in ancient Hindu spiritual books like the Vedas and the Yoga Upanishads. People probably
                believed in chakras before the information was ever written down.</p>
            <p class="line-break-bottom">
                In India and other parts of the East, beliefs about chakras were included in many systems of healing and
                spirituality, including Ayurveda, yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others. These systems developed around
                the idea of a life energy that flows through our bodies and the universe. The use of the chakras is
                thought to help connect with this life energy in different ways. For example, yoga uses breath and
                movement to bring energy into the body, and move it through the chakras. Ayurveda uses herbal medicine,
                meditation, and other practices to open the chakras and balance energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chakras became popular in the West beginning in the 1960s-1970s as part of “alternative” spiritual
                movements. Western traditions that sometimes use chakras include psychology and complementary medicine,
                as well as spiritual practices.
