        <p>There is an infinite number of chakras in the human body, but mostly we hear about the ‘seven chakras’. These
            can be named as root chakra, sacral chakra, solar plexus chakra, hear chakra, throat chakra, third eye
            chakra and crown chakra. A specific color, element, stone and yoga pose is associated with each chakra.
            Depending on whether these energy centres are healthy or blocked, you may experience different attributes of
            your physical, mental, and emotional health. </p>

        <div id="root">
            <h2 class="chakra-header">Root Chakra (Muladhara)</h2>
            <h3 class="mantra">"I can't grow from an unsteady foundation."</h3>
            <p>Represents our foundation. On the human body, it sits at the base of the spine and gives us the feeling
                of being grounded. When the root chakra is open, we feel confident in our ability to withstand
                challenges and stand on our own two feet. When it's blocked, we feel threatened, as if we're standing on
                unstable ground.</p>

            <h3 class="mantra">"I always honor others but not before myself."</h3>
            <p>Helps inform how we relate to our emotions and emotions of others. It also governs creativity and sexual
                energy. Those with a blocked sacral chakra could feel a lack of control in their lives.</p>

            <p>Speaks to your ability to be confident and in control of your life. If your solar plexus chakra is
                blocked, you might feel overwhelming amounts of shame and self-doubt. Those with open sacral chakras are
                free to express their true selves.</p>

            <h3 class="mantra">"When I love myself, loving others comes easily."</h3>
            <p>Bridge between the lower chakras and the upper chakras. This chakra can influence our ability to give and
                receive love from others and ourselves. Someone with a blocked heart chakra will have difficulty fully
                opening up to the people in their life. If someone's heart is open, they can experience deep compassion
                and empathy.</p>

                functioning at full capacity, it allows us to express ourselves truly and clearly. Someone with a
                blocked throat chakra will feel like they have trouble finding the words to say how they truly feel.</p>
