            <p>Your chakras are a complex energy system within your body and are the centres of spiritual power. When
                you are aware of this system, you are able to balance these energies. But what happens when our chakras
                become blocked? It may lead to difficulties with concentration, sleeping problems, a lack of motivation
                and feelings of helplessness, among many other things. However, there are many easy ways to unblock your
                chakras </p>

                        Mantras
                        <br>
                        A mantra is a short repetition that is often used at the end of a yoga practice. The mantra acts
                        as a form of sound healing that can restore your energy fields.

                        Tapping
                        <br>
                        The practice of tapping, or EFT, works by using your fingertips to tap on certain meridian
                        points throughout your body. The motion of tapping and repeating affirmations can help to let go
                        of certain emotions that may be blocking your chakras.

                        Chakra meditation
                        <br>
                        Chakra meditation can be a powerful technique for you to employ at home. It involves bringing
                        attention to yourself and focusing on your awareness.

                        Yoga
                        <br>
                        When a chakra is blocked, movement can be beneficial to releasing it. Yoga is a fantastic way to
                        do this as it encourages the flow of energy back into your body.

                        Essential Oils
                        <br>
                        Using certain essential oils is a great way to rebalance your chakras. Burning these oils in
                        your home is a way you can work to unblock your chakras yourself.

                        Nutrition
                        <br>
                        Including certain foods in your diet can help you to clear your energy system. Each chakra
                        correlates with certain foods so introducing these into your daily meals can really go a long
                        way to rebalancing your system.

                        Go out into nature
                        <br>
                        This is one of the easiest ways to unblock your chakras. Spending time outdoors, walking
                        barefoot in the grass, is a wonderful way to reconnect with nature and absorb its healing energy
                        keeping you grounded and at peace.

                        Take deep breaths
                        <br>
                        Taking deep breaths with intention is very effective for restoring your chakras to their natural
                        and harmonious state. As you inhale, direct your energy to the chakra. As you exhale, allow
                        awareness to relax into it.
